                        Useful if you want to write out if a particle would have passed a
                        cut or not.
                        Returns -999 if particle is a nullptr.
sin(variable)           Returns sin value of the given variable.
                        E.g. sin(?) returns the sine of the value of the variable.
useCMSFrame(variable)   Returns the value of the variable using the CMS frame as current
                        reference frame.
                        E.g. useCMSFrame(E) returns the energy of a particle in the CMS
                        frame.
useLabFrame(variable)   Returns the value of the variable using the lab frame as current
                        reference frame.
                        The lab frame is the default reference frame, usually you don't need
                        to use this meta-variable.
                        E.g. useLabFrame(E) returns the energy of a particle in the Lab
                        frame, same as just E.
                             useRestFrame(daughter(0, formula(E - useLabFrame(E)))) only
                        corner-cases like this need to use this variable.
useRestFrame(variable)  Returns the value of the variable using the rest frame of the given
                        particle as current reference frame.
                        E.g. useRestFrame(daughter(0, p)) returns the total momentum of the
                        first daughter in its mother's rest-frame
veto(particleList, cut, pdgCode = 11) Combines current particle with particles from the
                        given particle list and returns 1 if the combination passes the
                        provided cut.
                        For instance one can apply this function on a signal Photon and
                        provide a list of all photons in the rest of event and a cut
                        around the neutral Pion mass (e.g. 0.130 < M < 0.140).
                        If a combination of the signal Photon with a ROE photon fits this
                        criteria, hence looks like a neutral pion, the veto-Metavariable
                        will return 1

                        respect to E_cms/2.
correctedB_mbc          Returns beam constrained mass of B meson, corrected with the missing
                        neutrino momentum (reconstructed side + neutrino) with respect to
                        E_cms/2.
isInRestOfEvent         Returns 1 if a track, ecl or klmCluster associated to particle is in
                        the current RestOfEvent object, 0 otherwise.One can use this
                        variable only in a for_each loop over the RestOfEvent StoreArray.
nAllROEECLClusters      Returns number of all ECL clusters in the related RestOfEvent
                        object.
nAllROENeutralECLClusters Returns number of all ECL clusters in the related RestOfEvent
                        object.
nAllROETracks           Returns number of all tracks in the related RestOfEvent object.
nROEECLClusters         Returns number of ECL clusters in the related RestOfEvent object
                        that pass the selection criteria.
nROEKLMClusters         Returns number of remaining KLM clusters in the related RestOfEvent
                        object.
nROELeptons             Returns number of lepton particles in the related RestOfEvent
                        object.
nROENeutralECLClusters  Returns number of neutral ECL clusters in the related RestOfEvent
                        object that pass the selection criteria.
nROETracks              Returns number of tracks in the related RestOfEvent object that pass
                        the selection criteria.
nRemainingTracksInRestOfEvent Returns number of tracks in ROE - number of tracks of given
                        particleOne can use this variable only in a for_each loop over the
                        RestOfEvent StoreArray.
pionVeto                Returns the Flag 1 if a combination of photons has the invariant
                        mass of a neutral pion
roeMissMass(opt)        Returns the missing mass squared.Option 0: Take momentum and energy
                        of all ROE tracks and clusters into accountOption 1: Take only
                        momentum of ROE tracks and clusters into accountOption 2: Don't take
                        any ROE tracks and clusters into account, use signal side onlyOption
                        3: Same as option 2, but use the correction of the B meson momentum
                        magnitude in LABsystem in the direction of the ROE momentum
